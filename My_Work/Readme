Hello Professor,

I have posted 3-VM project's ScreenShots in my repository.

For the 4VM project, I put every Screenshots in #4-VM folder

  The idea is,
  for up to 1000 hosts, we can have 2^10=1024 hosts, in which we can use 1024-2=1022..
  for up to 200 hosts, we can have 2^8=256 hosts, in which we can use 256-2=254..
  for up to 60 hosts, we can have 2^6=64 hosts, in which we can use 64-2=62..
  
  For netmask in 1000 hosts, we have to take 10 bits of zeros continuously..
    Means netmask = 255.255.252.0
    So that we can have 32-10=22 continuously ones.
    
  For netmask in 200 hosts, we have to take 8 bits of zeros continuously..
    Means netmask = 255.255.255.0
    So that we can have 32-8=24 continuously ones.
    
  For netmask in 60 hosts, we have to take 6 bits of zeros continuously..
    Means netmask = 255.255.255.192
    So that we can have 32-6=26 continuously ones.
   
  So with the help of above information and the given Diagram,
    We basically need #3 networks, #3 hosts and #1 router.
   
    Host #1 : 
      Virtual Machine : 1
      Adapter Port : eth1
      Adapter Name : ethernet2
      Network : 172.17.200.0
      Netmask : 255.255.252.0
      Minimum Host ip : 172.17.200.1
      
    Host #2 : 
      Virtual Machine : 3
      Adapter Port : eth0
      Adapter Name : ethernet3
      Network : 185.90.80.0
      Netmask : 255.255.255.0
      Minimum Host ip : 185.90.80.1
    
    Host #3 : 
      Virtual Machine : 4
      Adapter Port : eth0
      Adapter Name : ethernet4
      Network : 20.30.40.0
      Netmask : 255.255.255.192
      Minimum Host ip : 20.30.40.1
      
    Router #1 : 
      Virtual Machine : 2
      Adapter Port : eth0
        Adapter Name : ethernet2
        Maximum ip : 172.17.200.254
        Netmask : 255.255.252.0
      Adapter Port : eth1
        Adapter Name : ethernet3
        Maximum ip : 185.90.80.254
        Netmask : 255.255.255.0
      Adapter Port : eth2
        Adapter Name : ethernet4
        Maximum ip : 20.30.40.62
        Netmask : 255.255.255.192
        
        
  Using these data, we can build the desire Network.    

  To make this working properly, Router(vm-2) has to have complete routing table. And for that, 
we have to first transmit the data from each of the VMs'. So that router can forword the acknowledgment also..
